**Statix is a C# static site generator** designed to create a flat-file websites from folders containing markdown files. Statix is ideal for creating small websites from GitHub repositories.

**How it works:** Statix crawls a directory tree and whenever it finds `index.md` it generates `index.html` according to HTML templates in the themes folder. The resulting site uses folder names as URLs.
